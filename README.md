# About Python Projects
A short overview of 3 of my Repos made for a Python Course

# Aspen Akunne

## Project #1
[Link](https://github.com/AkunneA/Book_Popularity)<br/>
Description: A project that has two parts:<br/> One is a webscraper that will scrape GoodRead's popularity pages for certain books. <br/> Another is a main program that will take a NYT best seller list from a certain amount of years and compare it to the new CSV file that was created from GoodReads.

## Project #2:
[Link](https://github.com/AkunneA/Mixed_Bag)<br/>
Description: An atempt to create multiple programs using different libraries. I will update these in the future and give them their own repos. 

## Project #3:
[Link](https://github.com/AkunneA/Timer_Project)<br/>
Description: A timer program that will take a random task from a user generated list and count down a certain amount of time. It's a sort of Pomodoro type program that will choose a task for a user. In future iterations, I would like to make it start on its own.
